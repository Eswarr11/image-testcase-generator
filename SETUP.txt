1. Navigate to the project directory: cd image-testcase-generator-1
2. Install dependencies: npm install
3. Build the application: npm run build
4. Start production server: npm start
5. Open browser to: http://localhost:3000

DEVELOPMENT:
- Run development mode: npm run dev
  - Backend server: http://localhost:3000
  - Frontend dev server: http://localhost:5173
- Use VS Code debugger configurations in .vscode/

INDIVIDUAL COMMANDS:
- Server only: npm run dev:server
- Client only: npm run dev:client
- Build server: npm run build:server
- Build client: npm run build:client
- Type checking: npm run type-check
- Linting: npm run lint

USAGE:
1. Enter your OpenAI API key in the web interface
2. Type a prompt describing what you want to test
3. Optionally upload images (max 9, up to 10MB each)
4. Click "Generate Test Case"
5. Copy to clipboard or export as CSV

DEBUGGING (VS Code):
- "Launch TypeScript Server (Development)": Debug backend
- "Debug React App": Debug frontend in Chrome
- "Attach to Server": Attach to running server
- Full TypeScript support with source maps

FEATURES:
- Full TypeScript implementation (backend + frontend)
- React 18 with modern hooks and contexts
- Tailwind CSS for beautiful, responsive UI
- OpenAI GPT-4o integration with image analysis
- Dark/Light theme with system preference detection
- Drag & drop image upload
- Real-time API key validation
- Comprehensive error handling
- CSV export with timestamps
- Toast notifications

ARCHITECTURE:
Backend (TypeScript):
- src/server.ts: Express server with security middleware
- dist/: Compiled JavaScript output

Frontend (React + TypeScript):
- client/src/: React application source
- client/src/components/: React components
- client/src/contexts/: React contexts (Theme, API Key, Toast)
- client/src/types/: TypeScript type definitions
- client/dist/: Built React application

Configuration:
- tsconfig.json: Server TypeScript config
- client/tsconfig.json: Client TypeScript config
- .vscode/: VS Code debugging configurations
- client/tailwind.config.js: Tailwind CSS configuration

API KEY SECURITY:
Your API key is stored locally in browser storage and never sent to our servers.
All requests go directly from your browser to OpenAI's API.
The key is validated in real-time for better user experience.
